<h1>The Best Movies According to Ahmet</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>This movie is the best movie I have ever watched. Because it has so much detailes mixed into a fascinating unreal world. And the director did this so perfectly that you lost yourself in the story of that movie.</p>
<h3>2. Pirates of Caribbean</h3>
<p>Similar to the LOTR here we have also very interesting story that you watch without blinking. Actors are also  very talented too. Especially Johnny Depp in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow was very succesfull. And he always makes you smile while watching him in that character.</p>
<h3>3. Bullet Train</h3>
<p>I find this movie very funny. The actors were really great and especially brad pitt. I don't remember any other movie  that I laughed in every scene.</p>
<p>Another thing I need to say is the songs in that movie, it goes like: <br />
You're Diesel<br />
Stayin' Alive
